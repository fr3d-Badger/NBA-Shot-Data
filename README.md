Data visualisation of the field goal data collected by @DomSamangy https://www.linkedin.com/in/dominicsamangy/
The Information about the data can be found on DomSamangy's page.
This was a project created for a university creative data art exhibition.

Each file has the code used and the PDF that displays the location of each field goal made by the MVP of that year. 
The files with the player names do not have the code, however I have attached a zip folder that contains the code and the data since the data set is too large.

The poster that has been created is labed data-art.pdf. This was the final product that was displayed in my university building.
